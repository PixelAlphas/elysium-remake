# elysium-remake
"Awakening in the wrong place. in the void of each dimensions structures. The only hope, is to get out of this darkness."

**Elysium: Remake** ( Demo ) is essentially a remake version of the 8k Bedrock Add-on's jam that i submitted as the original version are unfinished, rushed and so on. doesn't have story as it intended to be. This also can be replayable too. The project is **MIT Licensed**.

This remake includes a medium sized map, parkours and new mechanic, aswell cutscenes, sound effects, multiplayer support and so on. A Full fresh original map, even assets sometimes. This was made within 13 days ( obviously I'm too busy at other things... ) and once again, on a phone.
