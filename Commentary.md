## **Project**
Greetings, I'm **Harlow**. or aka Arxance. and welcome to "Elysium: Remake" commentary. All commentary stuff will be just me since this is a solo project.

You will see alot of rotating messaging icon across the map, that thing is a commentary mark and does have it's own unique comments.

This is a special project for "Bedrock Add-on"s 20k Jam within 3 weeks deadline. so, have fun. and merry christmas and new year!

## The Map
At the start, I wanted it to be an original map based on another project of mine, **Project: Designant**. though i realized that will probably be long and not only that, I can't use old stuff. so, this is all about Remake.

I don't feel confident enough, so I've started with remaking my previous public jam map called "Elysium". a short storyline based map. that's about it.

## Starting point
Originally, you wake on a literal nowhere on the abandoned skybase, on this remake. you wake on a
surrounded overworld's terrain chunks or in short, islands for now.

This is a way to wake up player's parkour skills by giving them probably easiest one imaginable and also allows them to wander some places.

Player also cannot die. so once you fall, you will be immediately teleported to a checkpoint with animation played.

## Gameplay
This one is little tricky to implement, but originally you search certain items to craft an grappling hook to progress. This remake changes everything.

Instead. you will gain parkour mechanic, aka **Energy Jump**. You hold the shift or sneak button for few seconds and you will jump higher than before. the longer, the higher you could reach. it's pretty useful to jump across unreachable islands or certain platform.

Not only that, you will also learn the **Checkpoint** mark aswell. that's basically the gameplay.

## Music (?) / SFX
Working with FL mobile is quite a headache sometimes, with the help of few anonymous persons (whom wish not to be named), I've managed to create 30+ SFXs and few songs. Unfortunately, Only couple of SFXs and No songs make it to this remake. all of those does not fit whatsoever.

Obviously, it will not be wasted and will be reused on my future project.

## Easter eggs
I went abit overboard with this, but seeing some weird skyblock clone everywhere on marketplace makes me vent it here. You'll likely saw one across during gameplay. Also other one was some person /kill'in lawnmower 2 years ago.

There's probably more, you can find them :)

## Dialog / UI
The UI has gone alot of changes throughout the development. well, obviously I'm more of UI and texture pack person, so this is my area of expertise.

As you already seen it, you can use buttons to skip dialog or show all just like every MMORPG games.

Originally this remake will have an animated UI and uses the same tech from **Project: Designant**. unfortunately, this is pretty experimental and is also pretty expensive to implement. therefore i just skipped it entirely.

Also, this remake does not have a quest. so therefore you'll have to follow what you "said" on the dialogue. (Again, countermeasures on "going anywhere without roadblock")

## Animations
Not just UI that gets animations, there's model and cutscene aswell. I've spent several hours on it and in the end I'm only able to produce 7 anims for Rustic.

And unfortunately, only 1 animation were used and only 1 cutscene exist. since it take long time and it runs the project pretty thin for a solo project like this.

## Islands
When you progress, you will see a tall witch castle with a robot inside. originally there's not much dialogue for it since the jam is like 1 week. This time I've included actually bunch of dialogue even a secret one. hope you find them though.

Originally you are supposed to carry some thing secret with a new character aswell. though deadline is pretty close while working on. so, Lawnmower sticker it is. 

## End...?
In both version, you basically. interact lawnmower to finish the map. At the time I'm working on, The remake version are supposed to have a different character aside from just Rustic. turned out it's pretty difficult to come with something with a deadline coming closer. so i basically remake the lawnmower model, and added sticker instead.

This project supposed to have 2 dimensions, one is "Elysium" and "Aquarium". it were pretty unfinished so, can't do much.
